# Frequently asked questions

## How up-to-date is the data?

The data is published to the site approximately every 24 hours. The data for
Open Disclosure is based on campaign finance filing deadlines established by the
State of California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) for all state and
local candidates and ballot measures in the November 2016 election.

Reporting Period    | FPPC Filing Deadline
----------------    | --------------------
1/1/2016 – 6/30/16  | August 1, 2016
7/1/16 – 9/24/16    | September 29, 2016
9/25/16 – 10/22/16  | October 27, 2016
10/23/16 – 12/31/16 | January 31, 2017

In addition to these filing deadlines, contributions of $1,000 or more from
a single source made to candidate and ballot measure committees within the 90
days prior to the election (8/10/16-11/8/16) must be reported within 24 hours.
