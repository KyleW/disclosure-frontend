# About

_Open Disclosure California is currently in beta._


## Open Disclosure California

Despite California reporting requirements for campaign finance, data is obscured
from the public view through data in-accessibility. Public information is locked
up in PDFs or printed paper in many jurisdictions. Those with enough resources,
contract with third-parties to handle collection of required campaign finance
data reporting.


## The vision

Netfile serves over 40 jurisdictions in California. By tapping into their APIs,
Open Disclosure California can shed some light on the local elections of 30% of
California jurisdictions.


## California Civic Lab

California Civic Lab is a coalition of brigades, journalists, reform groups, and
public officials committed to improving California governance by making civic
information more open and accessible.


## About the Team

The Open Disclosure team is a group of volunteer civic hackers that include
developers, data scientists, policy wonks, civic workers, designers, and
journalists. They share a passion about open data, transparency, and shining
light on the funding that fuels electoral campaigns.

All development on OpenDisclosure happens publicly on
[Github](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-frontend). We invite any
questions or suggestions for improvementâ€“just [create an issue on
Github](https://github.com/caciviclab/disclosure-frontend/issues/new?labels=type%2Fquestion)!
